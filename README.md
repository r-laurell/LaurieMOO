# LaurieMOO
I coded the app LaurieMoo as a project for Programming 2 in Java Intellij. The idea of the application was to create a game that gives you ten attempts to guess a four-digit number randomly generated by the game. For each of the digit correctly specified by position, the screen will get a "MOO!" displayed by the program. For each of the digits that is not in the correct the position but it is in the solution, a "moo" is given. If all the digits are in the correct order then the screen will display a "LaurieMOO!!!" to inform the user.
